## CHAPTER 1 WINNING ANSWERS EVERY TIME

### Scoring a Goal with Every Answer

- At the very least, your responses should involve explaining why you can't answer a particular question and then adding something extra that's useful and to the point.
- What you should do is implement the “3 Ps” of the verbal communications world – Plan, Prepare and Practice.


### Taking Inspiration from a Master

- To put the crash in a vastly broader context, in order to highlight Virgin's historically good safety record.


### Learning What _Not_ to Do

- Whatever the situation, there will be positives he can point to that will be far better than what was originally said.
- Answering a question directly doesn't mean you have to be a slave to it. Under the rules of normal conversation you are allowed to say more. And in most cases you should.
- You are in the position of the giver. You can be generous. You should give of your time, expertise and effort. And in this way you also shift the focus to where you want it – the place where your interests and those of your questioner and any wider audience overlap.

## CHAPTER 2 CRAFTING THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO UNDERPIN EVERY ANSWER

### Crafting That Message Your Questioners Need

- But when answering tough questions you typically don't want to be giving just facts alone. People who give great answers do more than merely convey facts.
- To give a great answer you need to get across a clear message, just as you would have had to do when managing those four-year-old footballers in the first chapter.
- A message can contain facts – and that can be a good thing.
- But a message is a bigger concept than one or more facts.
- It is far more than that, as an effective message leaves the audience with something distinct to contemplate, react to and possibly act upon – and hopefully even to benefit from.
- The message is the major underlying point that the audience ultimately takes away.



### Determine Your Message First, Then Formulate Your Answer

- You typically want to establish what your message is first, before working out the detail of a great answer.
- To help you work out what your message is, ask yourself this question: “What do I want the listener/s to be thinking or feeling or doing after our conversation?”
- You may or may not end up including your message directly in your answer. But your message is what will guide the direction of it. Once you are clear on what the message is, then it's so much easier to work out how the answer should be phrased.
- But once you have become clear in your own mind about the message you want to convey to a particular audience, you will make it so much easier to find the actual words you need to use.
- By starting with the outcome of the conversation you have in mind, you can determine the message or messages to drive things towards that outcome by the way you word your answers.



### What Is the Message?

- And if she had taken the trouble to write down her central message beforehand to guide her, then the actual message itself was probably something even more succinct.
- At the centre of every great answer is a great message that comes across clearly and credibly – and with some emotional punch.
- A strong negative message can sometimes be appropriate and effective. Your accountant might usefully warn you: “If you don't pay your taxes on time, you'll have to pay extra.”
- To underpin your great answers on your topic you need a message that is succinct, powerful and which will stick with your audience.


### WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF YOU?

In this analogy, the leaves are the words that make up our answers. This is what listeners hear. But there needs to be considerable substance behind those words to ensure your answers are truly great. The stems represent the thoughts behind the actual words of the answers. The twigs are the bigger ideas that prompt the individual thoughts. The branches are emblematic of the policies and propositions behind the individual thoughts and ideas. The trunk represents the guiding philosophy that underpins those policies and practices. It embodies the central purpose of the tree. And the root system – upon which the tree's whole existence depends – represents the core values.


### Formulating Your Key Message

- Fundamental to being able to give great answers is to have a good understanding of those asking you the questions and those listening to your answers.
- The key word here is “empathy”. It's the capacity to place yourself in the shoes of others.
- So if you're doing a presentation that will involve a question and answer session, you want to find out from the event organizer what you can about the audience:
    - How much do they know about the topic you will be talking about?
    - What might their existing views on it be?
    - What is it that they will be most wanting to know on the topic?
- Your audience members will typically have an agenda in any situation. This is what they want to get out of the session and what they would like to get out of you. You can often work out what that agenda is.
- So you need to work out how to appeal to their agenda and, if they want you, they will have to work out how to appeal to your agenda.


### Crafting That Great Message

- It boils down to something short and simple – but there should be much substance behind it.
- Great messages are typically expressed in a single sentence; though sometimes it is good to break them in two.
- While being succinct – even terse – the message says a lot.
- In your initial planning it's more important to get the message right for the particular audience and the particular situation, rather than for it to sound brilliant.


### Combining Fact and Emotion in Your Message

- A great message also contains an emotional element as well as a factual element.
- A great message with a strong emotional component also has the stickiness factor, so your audience will remember it long after it's been delivered.
- If you come up with a fantastically snappy, powerful and memorable way to word the message, that's marvelous.

## CHAPTER 3  HARNESSING THE POWER OF STORIES

### Great Stories Prompt Change

- Stories touch people emotionally. They can comfort. They can persuade. They can inspire.


### Painting Pictures in the Minds of Your Audience

- When you are telling stories you are, on the face of it, sharing a carefully constructed series of words with your audience. But what is really happening if you are doing it well is that you're using those words to paint moving pictures in the minds of your listeners. If you're really good you will be using these words and pictures to direct the emotions in the hearts of your audience.
- When you do it supremely well you get people coming out with responses like “I can see what you mean”. What they are effectively saying, of course, is that they can visualize it in their imagination.
- But the proof points can also consist of relevant facts and figures. They can be insightful observations. They can be metaphors or analogies.
- They especially need to use stories and examples if they are dealing with the abstract. This is because abstract concepts, important though they often are, need to be illustrated in our minds to enable audiences to picture what is meant.



### Going Up and Down the Abstract Ladder

His “Ladder of Abstraction” concept identifies the fact that there are different levels of language used that range from the general to the specific.

On the bottom rungs of the ladder are concrete things, which are easy to identify and see.

On the top rungs of the ladder are abstract concepts that are bigger, more ethereal and can be harder to envisage.

Highly effective communicators tend to metaphorically move up and down the ladder with considerable frequency. This helps to keep their audiences fully in the picture by allowing them to grasp both the general and the specific.

If someone gets stuck at the top of the ladder for too long they are in danger of talking as if viewing the world from that mythical ivory tower – making it hard for listeners to picture what they are thinking.

If someone gets stuck at the bottom of the ladder for too long they can bury their listeners in a heap of details, with the audience struggling to see how they fit together to make sense. They give too many fragments of the situation on the ground and we don't get the much-needed panoramic overview.


### Taking a Journey Down That Ladder

So that's what needs to happen for your listeners when you give an answer that spells out a general concept. You should then take them down the ladder and present them with an example that is sufficiently vivid that they can see, hear and feel it – and possibly even care about it as well.


### Using Stories to Grab and Wow Your Audience

Here's what TRUTH stands for:
- **T = Topical.** - If the case study runs past its sell-by date and is no longer significant to the latest developments, then ruthlessly toss it out of your treasure chest and replace it with a new one.
- **R = Relevant.** - Most people tend to be more interested in what's happening nearby. A story that has local proximity is bound to have greater impact with your audience in that area.
- **U = Unusual.** - Where you can, look for the exceptional story that stands out by being unusual and has the biggest surprise or wow factor. Be aware that sometimes, when looking for the right example, it's beneficial to seek out a typical rather than an extraordinary one. However, you still want to gather enough of the right colourful and fascinating details about it so that it will stick in the audience's mind.
- **T = Trouble.** - When choosing examples for your treasure chest, it may be more a case of picking instances where your organization's product or service or insights helped overcome a group's or an individual's brush with some kind of trouble.
- **H = Human** - So it can be important to show in a success story that what you or your organization did had a positive emotional outcome for one or more people.

## CHAPTER 4  FINDING OUT IN ADVANCE – THEN PLANNING FOR IT

- You want to get as much knowledge as you can ahead of each situation before the action starts.
- When you're going into a vital conversation that's critical to your career or the future of your organization it's exactly the same.
- You want to get ahead in the game by finding out as much about the situation in advance as you can.
- This enables you do some planning, preparation and practice.
- The golden rule is, if at all possible, never allow yourself to be rushed into a challenging professional conversation without the chance of knowing what it's about in advance and doing some preparation.


### Getting It Right in That Set-Up Discussion

- The trick is to think ahead when someone is approaching you to arrange that big conversation and get an idea of what territory you might be heading for.




### Having a Pro-Active and Reactive Plan
- In planning for important professional conversations, you typically want to have a pro-active plan and a reactive plan to deal with questions.
- The pro-active plan involves having great messages and illustrations ready for where you can and should be getting across initial positive points. The reactive plan is your insurance policy readying you for tough questions that could conceivably be asked.



### Getting Your Preparation Right
Here's what AMEN stands for:
- **A = Audience.** Whether you are dealing with a one-to-one conversation or a larger gathering, always identify your audience and focus your preparations on what they require. And if you don't know the make-up or thinking of your audience – if it's for answering questions as part of a presentation for a new client, for example – then do a little research to find out.
- **M = Messages.** You'll recall from earlier chapters, your encounter is an opportunity to get across your messages. So work out your headline message – and any additional messages you wish to convey as part of your pro-active and reactive plans.
- **E = Examples.** Pick out examples and/or real life stories from your treasure chest that back up each of your messages most effectively for that particular audience, so you can come down that Ladder of Abstraction and bring them alive in the minds of your listeners.
- **N = Negatives.** Write down all the negative questions that could be thrown at you. This is the key part of your reactive plan. Don't hold back here. Phrase the negative questions in the toughest, most ferocious way you can. In reality the questions you actually get may well turn out not be worded as nastily as you phrase them. But the principle here is use the same approach that many effective sports coaches deploy when preparing their team for a tough contest: “Train hard, and play easy. ” So if you train for the harshest conditions, when it comes to the reality of playing the game for real it will probably be easier for you than it was in training – and you should perform all the better as a result.



### Turning a Negative Mindset to a Positive One

- What you do at this stage is write down things that will force you to focus in a realistically positive manner.
- Why did the product you sold us break in the first five minutes of us using it?
- Now it may well be appropriate that you express sympathy and probably apologize at the start of your answer, but we will deal with this in forthcoming chapters.
- You will also need to formulate a positive headline message to sum up your approach.
- It may be something like: “On rare occasions when something goes wrong with our products we make sure it's rectified as soon as possible, that the customer is given an extra bonus as compensation and that we learn any lessons from what happened to ensure our products are constantly being improved.”
- This headline message, combined with the “best things you can say” list, helps you to magically get into the right positive mindset to deal with the tough issue and gives you supremely useful material to inject into the conversation.
- So in your list of “best things you can say” you can include points such as:
    - We have a policy of immediately replacing any product that proves less than perfect – and also giving the affected customer a high value gift certificate as a goodwill gesture
    - Tests and surveys have shown that the products that break in the first year of use are less than one in ten-thousand
    - In the unusual event of a product breaking we ensure it is examined by our laboratory so that we can work out what has occurred and how best to prevent the same thing from happening again in the future
    - We have a quality control team which is constantly looking at our processes to ensure there is focus on continual improvement on our systems and products.
- Apply the “best things you can say” approach to your preparation to face all your tough questions.

## CHAPTER 5  THE FIRST GOLDEN FORMULA – SIMPLE AS ABCDE

- When you're asked a tough question, your standard practice at the start of your reply is something that takes a lot of people by surprise.
- You need to get straight to the point, tell the truth and actually answer it if you possibly can.


### How you Structure Your Answer is Critical

- Exactly _how_ you actually convey this truth as part of the whole of your answer is the critical thing.
- While giving the appropriate factual information in your answer, you need to make sure you ALSO convey something extra.
- The extra something you must add is a crucial positive message.
- This positive message has to be related to the question – so it's effectively providing an additional benefit for your audience.
- This positive message should be inspired by and in harmony with your list of “best things you can say”.
- In order to respond to the question in a way that is simultaneously bombproof and impressive, you need to know something really important: how to structure your answer.
- But the structure is not something the typical human brain seems to work out intuitively for itself.


### Deal with the Bad – Then Gravitate to the Positive

- The First Golden Formula involves speaking exact truths that will stand up to robust scrutiny.
- You may enable them to view the situation in a wider context.
- Or you may show them helpful things that are beyond the confines of their question.
- And you need to do it in such a way that you are saying what should be said, rather than allowing yourself to be a mere slave to any limitations in their question.
- It's important to understand that simply addressing the challenging aspect of the question is not enough to constitute a truly great answer.
- Central to your great answer is the premise that once you have dealt with any bad stuff, you are then entitled to gravitate to the positive and say that something extra.
- For example, the positive may well include saying what you are doing about the bad stuff in order to put things right.
- The key thing to remember is this: **_Once you have given the initially requested response, then you are perfectly entitled – sometimes even duty bound – to convey a positive message that will be in the interests of your listeners_.**


#### A = Answer or Acknowledge the Question

- If you know the answer and are allowed to give it out, then do so upfront.
- But what about when you don't know the answer – or for some legitimate reason you are under constraints not to disclose the answer?
- If you can't reveal what the answer is, then A = Acknowledge
    - You acknowledge openly that you can't answer it.
    - The crucial thing here is to immediately explain WHY you can't answer it.
    - If you briefly give the reason why you don't know the answer, or why you're not allowed to give it out, then this can instantaneously take the pressure out of what can otherwise be a tense situation.
    - Often there is an excellent reason for not knowing or not disclosing.
    - For example, you may not know because your research team is still working to find out what the answer is. So say so!
    - And – if practical and appropriate – explain that you will let the questioner know what the answer is as soon as you discover it. Make sure you follow through on this, because your credibility is on the line here.
- This is an area that causes so many people so much grief, simply because they don't say why they can't reply. So they stumble, mutter, sweat, get embarrassed, look guilty, feel guilty and worse.
- At this point you have given the start of a great answer, but giving a truthful, factual response upfront is typically just the beginning.
- You must move things on – so that you kick that goal or hit that home run with your answer.


#### B = Crossing the Bridge to the Positive

- A “bridge” in this context is a verbal tool that, having dealt with the question in your initial response, or acknowledged why you can't, enables you to move things on to a more productive and useful space.
- A typical bridge is:
    - “What's really important is. . .”
    - “What everyone needs to understand is. . .”
    - “To put the situation in a wider context. . .”
    - “But. . .” (a supremely simple bridge)
    - “And. . .” (another simple bridge – and potentially a positive one)
- The crucial thing is that, having dealt with any bad stuff in A, you must then use B to enable you to verbally cross over onto positive territory.
- That leads on to C.


#### C = Get Across the Content of Your Message (which is typically positive)
- Given that you typically have a number of positive messages you need to get across – inspired by your list of “best things you can say” – you need to select the message that relates most closely to the question.
- It could be your headline message, or it could be one of your other support messages.




#### D + E = Dangle an Example
- When you have conveyed your message and delivered the content of your key message, you then “dangle” an “example”.
- So, a typical dangle is something like this: “A really good example of what I'm saying is. . .” or “Let me tell you a story about how it once worked in the past. . .”
- This is where you come down that “Ladder of Abstraction” (see [Chapter 3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/great-answers-to/9780857086396/c03.xhtml)) to paint a picture in the minds of your audience so they can literally see what you mean.
- People often struggle to know when to finish their answers. Ending on the example enables you to conclude crisply and decisively on a high.
- Your example or story doesn't have to be funny – it can be quite the opposite. But it gives you a chance to draw your answer to a clear-cut and authoritative ending.
- And that's what you do and keep doing every time you get a tough question.



### Making the Formula Work for You
- you need to prepare for a question from your line manager such as: “Isn't it fair to say that your performance has been poor largely because of your lack of attention to detail, as underlined by those complaints from two customers, which indicates you are not suited to being a sales rep?”
- We can start by compiling that list of “the best things you can say”. These include:
    - You have nearly always hit your monthly sales targets.
    - The majority of your customers are happy with what you've been doing over the past year.
    - Most of your colleagues who you have discussed your performance with believe you are making very good progress.
    - You are working at overcoming your challenge of needing to pay more attention to detail, and with the help of colleagues you have worked out a way to tackle it which is proving effective.
    - You have successfully been exploring new avenues for sales in other industries.
- Now let's apply the ABCDE formula to that horrid question which, to remind you, is:
  > _“Isn't it fair to say that your performance has been poor largely because of your lack of attention to detail, as underlined by those complaints from two customers, which indicates you are not well-suited to being a sales rep?”_

    - A: “No, it isn't. Overall progress has been going very well, which is underlined by the fact that I have met my monthly sales targets in 11 out of the first 12 months and the overwhelming majority of my customers say they're very happy with my service.”
    - B: “And what's really important is that I have found ways I can take my performance to a higher level in future.”
    - C: “With the help of my colleagues, who have been very positive about my progress, I have a way of guaranteeing that the order forms are correctly completed by ensuring that I always check them over with the client before they are lodged. I now pass this tip on to new people joining the team. And I have been growing the market for the company by successfully exploring new avenues for sales in industries where we haven't previously been active.”
    - D: “The best example of this is. . .”
    - E: “I have built up contacts in the mobile phone industry by using social media and have now been making sales to XYZ Mobiles. This has been so successful that I'm in discussions about what could turn out to be one of the biggest orders in our company's history, valued at over £200,000 a year.
- You've successfully come down the “Ladder of Abstraction” and dangled a big future opportunity for the company, which has been unearthed due to your initiative, so giving a powerful incentive for the company to keep you on in your sales rep role.



### Phrasing Answers with Your Positive Words
- Repeating negatives ensures that you generate a negative impression, and also traps your performance within the unhelpful vocabulary of your questioner.
- You certainly need to respond effectively to any negative words underpinning negative questions, but the trick is to do so in such a way that you control the language.
- When in conversation, the human brain isn't very good at dealing with the concept of “not” in front of a negative.
- So, repeating a negative word while putting “not” before it tends to reinforce the negative concept in the minds of your listeners.



### How to Avoid Echoing Negatives
- One way to avoid echoing back negatives is to use something called a “blocking phrase”. This means that you start your answer with something that instantly deadens the power of the negative words being used against you.
- In other situations, which may be less clear-cut, a straight denial may not be justifiable or credible.
- In these instances you can use a more neutral blocking phrase, such as: “Let me put it like this. . .”
- Whenever negative words are thrown at you in a question, your blocking phrase should be used at the start of “A” in The First Golden Formula.
- Using a blocking phrase and then carefully selecting the right positive words to follow it puts you in charge of your answer and of making a favourable impression.
- This technique also stops you inadvertently buying into a false premise, and allows you to positively reframe a situation to your advantage.



### Moving from the Specific to the General
- This applies to a situation where you are asked about something very specific, which you don't know much about – or something where it may be unwise to go into detail.
- What you can do in these circumstances is apply a rule called “The Specific to the General”.
- So, you can say something like: “I'm unable to talk about the details of this situation because of advice from our lawyers, but what I can say is that the key principles we follow when faced with this kind of situation are. . .”
- Here, the first part about being unable to talk about the details is your “A” for acknowledge, the “B” for bridge is “but what I can say is. . .” and the rest of it will be your “C” for the content of your message.




### Moving from the General to the Specific
- This rule helps you shift the focus from a general situation that may be difficult to talk about onto a specific aspect of it that you may be much better equipped to discuss.
- Hence this rule is called – as you can possibly guess – “The General to the Specific”.
- So your answer can be framed something like: “This question relates to a subject which is outside my zone of expertise, but what I can tell you about is one particular instance in that area where we achieved a very positive outcome which was. . .”




### Dictating that Next Question
- The better you are doing with your answers, the more control you will have over the direction of the whole conversation.
