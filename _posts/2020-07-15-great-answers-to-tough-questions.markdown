## CHAPTER 1 WINNING ANSWERS EVERY TIME

### Scoring a Goal with Every Answer

- At the very least, your responses should involve explaining why you can't answer a particular question and then adding something extra that's useful and to the point.
- What you should do is implement the “3 Ps” of the verbal communications world – Plan, Prepare and Practice.


### Taking Inspiration from a Master

- To put the crash in a vastly broader context, in order to highlight Virgin's historically good safety record.


### Learning What _Not_ to Do

- Whatever the situation, there will be positives he can point to that will be far better than what was originally said.
- Answering a question directly doesn't mean you have to be a slave to it. Under the rules of normal conversation you are allowed to say more. And in most cases you should.
- You are in the position of the giver. You can be generous. You should give of your time, expertise and effort. And in this way you also shift the focus to where you want it – the place where your interests and those of your questioner and any wider audience overlap.

## CHAPTER 2 CRAFTING THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO UNDERPIN EVERY ANSWER

### Crafting That Message Your Questioners Need

- But when answering tough questions you typically don't want to be giving just facts alone. People who give great answers do more than merely convey facts.
- To give a great answer you need to get across a clear message, just as you would have had to do when managing those four-year-old footballers in the first chapter.
- A message can contain facts – and that can be a good thing.
- But a message is a bigger concept than one or more facts.
- It is far more than that, as an effective message leaves the audience with something distinct to contemplate, react to and possibly act upon – and hopefully even to benefit from.
- The message is the major underlying point that the audience ultimately takes away.



### Determine Your Message First, Then Formulate Your Answer

- You typically want to establish what your message is first, before working out the detail of a great answer.
- To help you work out what your message is, ask yourself this question: “What do I want the listener/s to be thinking or feeling or doing after our conversation?”
- You may or may not end up including your message directly in your answer. But your message is what will guide the direction of it. Once you are clear on what the message is, then it's so much easier to work out how the answer should be phrased.
- But once you have become clear in your own mind about the message you want to convey to a particular audience, you will make it so much easier to find the actual words you need to use.
- By starting with the outcome of the conversation you have in mind, you can determine the message or messages to drive things towards that outcome by the way you word your answers.



### What Is the Message?

- And if she had taken the trouble to write down her central message beforehand to guide her, then the actual message itself was probably something even more succinct.
- At the centre of every great answer is a great message that comes across clearly and credibly – and with some emotional punch.
- A strong negative message can sometimes be appropriate and effective. Your accountant might usefully warn you: “If you don't pay your taxes on time, you'll have to pay extra.”
- To underpin your great answers on your topic you need a message that is succinct, powerful and which will stick with your audience.


### WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF YOU?

In this analogy, the leaves are the words that make up our answers. This is what listeners hear. But there needs to be considerable substance behind those words to ensure your answers are truly great. The stems represent the thoughts behind the actual words of the answers. The twigs are the bigger ideas that prompt the individual thoughts. The branches are emblematic of the policies and propositions behind the individual thoughts and ideas. The trunk represents the guiding philosophy that underpins those policies and practices. It embodies the central purpose of the tree. And the root system – upon which the tree's whole existence depends – represents the core values.


### Formulating Your Key Message

- Fundamental to being able to give great answers is to have a good understanding of those asking you the questions and those listening to your answers.
- The key word here is “empathy”. It's the capacity to place yourself in the shoes of others.
- So if you're doing a presentation that will involve a question and answer session, you want to find out from the event organizer what you can about the audience:
    - How much do they know about the topic you will be talking about?
    - What might their existing views on it be?
    - What is it that they will be most wanting to know on the topic?
- Your audience members will typically have an agenda in any situation. This is what they want to get out of the session and what they would like to get out of you. You can often work out what that agenda is.
- So you need to work out how to appeal to their agenda and, if they want you, they will have to work out how to appeal to your agenda.


### Crafting That Great Message

- It boils down to something short and simple – but there should be much substance behind it.
- Great messages are typically expressed in a single sentence; though sometimes it is good to break them in two.
- While being succinct – even terse – the message says a lot.
- In your initial planning it's more important to get the message right for the particular audience and the particular situation, rather than for it to sound brilliant.


### Combining Fact and Emotion in Your Message

- A great message also contains an emotional element as well as a factual element.
- A great message with a strong emotional component also has the stickiness factor, so your audience will remember it long after it's been delivered.
- If you come up with a fantastically snappy, powerful and memorable way to word the message, that's marvelous.

## CHAPTER 3  HARNESSING THE POWER OF STORIES

### Great Stories Prompt Change

- Stories touch people emotionally. They can comfort. They can persuade. They can inspire.


### Painting Pictures in the Minds of Your Audience

- When you are telling stories you are, on the face of it, sharing a carefully constructed series of words with your audience. But what is really happening if you are doing it well is that you're using those words to paint moving pictures in the minds of your listeners. If you're really good you will be using these words and pictures to direct the emotions in the hearts of your audience.
- When you do it supremely well you get people coming out with responses like “I can see what you mean”. What they are effectively saying, of course, is that they can visualize it in their imagination.
- But the proof points can also consist of relevant facts and figures. They can be insightful observations. They can be metaphors or analogies.
- They especially need to use stories and examples if they are dealing with the abstract. This is because abstract concepts, important though they often are, need to be illustrated in our minds to enable audiences to picture what is meant.



### Going Up and Down the Abstract Ladder

His “Ladder of Abstraction” concept identifies the fact that there are different levels of language used that range from the general to the specific.

On the bottom rungs of the ladder are concrete things, which are easy to identify and see.

On the top rungs of the ladder are abstract concepts that are bigger, more ethereal and can be harder to envisage.

Highly effective communicators tend to metaphorically move up and down the ladder with considerable frequency. This helps to keep their audiences fully in the picture by allowing them to grasp both the general and the specific.

If someone gets stuck at the top of the ladder for too long they are in danger of talking as if viewing the world from that mythical ivory tower – making it hard for listeners to picture what they are thinking.

If someone gets stuck at the bottom of the ladder for too long they can bury their listeners in a heap of details, with the audience struggling to see how they fit together to make sense. They give too many fragments of the situation on the ground and we don't get the much-needed panoramic overview.


### Taking a Journey Down That Ladder

So that's what needs to happen for your listeners when you give an answer that spells out a general concept. You should then take them down the ladder and present them with an example that is sufficiently vivid that they can see, hear and feel it – and possibly even care about it as well.


### Using Stories to Grab and Wow Your Audience

Here's what TRUTH stands for:
- **T = Topical.** - If the case study runs past its sell-by date and is no longer significant to the latest developments, then ruthlessly toss it out of your treasure chest and replace it with a new one.
- **R = Relevant.** - Most people tend to be more interested in what's happening nearby. A story that has local proximity is bound to have greater impact with your audience in that area.
- **U = Unusual.** - Where you can, look for the exceptional story that stands out by being unusual and has the biggest surprise or wow factor. Be aware that sometimes, when looking for the right example, it's beneficial to seek out a typical rather than an extraordinary one. However, you still want to gather enough of the right colourful and fascinating details about it so that it will stick in the audience's mind.
- **T = Trouble.** - When choosing examples for your treasure chest, it may be more a case of picking instances where your organization's product or service or insights helped overcome a group's or an individual's brush with some kind of trouble.
- **H = Human** - So it can be important to show in a success story that what you or your organization did had a positive emotional outcome for one or more people.
