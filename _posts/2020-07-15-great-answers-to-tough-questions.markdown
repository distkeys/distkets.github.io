## CHAPTER 1 WINNING ANSWERS EVERY TIME

### Scoring a Goal with Every Answer

- At the very least, your responses should involve explaining why you can't answer a particular question and then adding something extra that's useful and to the point.
- What you should do is implement the “3 Ps” of the verbal communications world – Plan, Prepare and Practice.


### Taking Inspiration from a Master

- To put the crash in a vastly broader context, in order to highlight Virgin's historically good safety record.


### Learning What _Not_ to Do

- Whatever the situation, there will be positives he can point to that will be far better than what was originally said.
- Answering a question directly doesn't mean you have to be a slave to it. Under the rules of normal conversation you are allowed to say more. And in most cases you should.
- You are in the position of the giver. You can be generous. You should give of your time, expertise and effort. And in this way you also shift the focus to where you want it – the place where your interests and those of your questioner and any wider audience overlap.

## CHAPTER 2 CRAFTING THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO UNDERPIN EVERY ANSWER

### Crafting That Message Your Questioners Need

- But when answering tough questions you typically don't want to be giving just facts alone. People who give great answers do more than merely convey facts.
- To give a great answer you need to get across a clear message, just as you would have had to do when managing those four-year-old footballers in the first chapter.
- A message can contain facts – and that can be a good thing.
- But a message is a bigger concept than one or more facts.
- It is far more than that, as an effective message leaves the audience with something distinct to contemplate, react to and possibly act upon – and hopefully even to benefit from.
- The message is the major underlying point that the audience ultimately takes away.



### Determine Your Message First, Then Formulate Your Answer

- You typically want to establish what your message is first, before working out the detail of a great answer.
- To help you work out what your message is, ask yourself this question: “What do I want the listener/s to be thinking or feeling or doing after our conversation?”
- You may or may not end up including your message directly in your answer. But your message is what will guide the direction of it. Once you are clear on what the message is, then it's so much easier to work out how the answer should be phrased.
- But once you have become clear in your own mind about the message you want to convey to a particular audience, you will make it so much easier to find the actual words you need to use.
- By starting with the outcome of the conversation you have in mind, you can determine the message or messages to drive things towards that outcome by the way you word your answers.



### What Is the Message?

- And if she had taken the trouble to write down her central message beforehand to guide her, then the actual message itself was probably something even more succinct.
- At the centre of every great answer is a great message that comes across clearly and credibly – and with some emotional punch.
- A strong negative message can sometimes be appropriate and effective. Your accountant might usefully warn you: “If you don't pay your taxes on time, you'll have to pay extra.”
- To underpin your great answers on your topic you need a message that is succinct, powerful and which will stick with your audience.


### WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF YOU?

In this analogy, the leaves are the words that make up our answers. This is what listeners hear. But there needs to be considerable substance behind those words to ensure your answers are truly great. The stems represent the thoughts behind the actual words of the answers. The twigs are the bigger ideas that prompt the individual thoughts. The branches are emblematic of the policies and propositions behind the individual thoughts and ideas. The trunk represents the guiding philosophy that underpins those policies and practices. It embodies the central purpose of the tree. And the root system – upon which the tree's whole existence depends – represents the core values.


### Formulating Your Key Message

- Fundamental to being able to give great answers is to have a good understanding of those asking you the questions and those listening to your answers.
- The key word here is “empathy”. It's the capacity to place yourself in the shoes of others.
- So if you're doing a presentation that will involve a question and answer session, you want to find out from the event organizer what you can about the audience:
    - How much do they know about the topic you will be talking about?
    - What might their existing views on it be?
    - What is it that they will be most wanting to know on the topic?
- Your audience members will typically have an agenda in any situation. This is what they want to get out of the session and what they would like to get out of you. You can often work out what that agenda is.
- So you need to work out how to appeal to their agenda and, if they want you, they will have to work out how to appeal to your agenda.


### Crafting That Great Message

- It boils down to something short and simple – but there should be much substance behind it.
- Great messages are typically expressed in a single sentence; though sometimes it is good to break them in two.
- While being succinct – even terse – the message says a lot.
- In your initial planning it's more important to get the message right for the particular audience and the particular situation, rather than for it to sound brilliant.


### Combining Fact and Emotion in Your Message

- A great message also contains an emotional element as well as a factual element.
- A great message with a strong emotional component also has the stickiness factor, so your audience will remember it long after it's been delivered.
- If you come up with a fantastically snappy, powerful and memorable way to word the message, that's marvelous.
